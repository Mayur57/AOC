# Advent of Code 2023

Advent of Code solutions repository. Here, you'll find my attempts at solving the puzzles.

Days Completed: **3/25**

Make sure you have attempted the puzzles beforehand if not submitted the answers.

Just a heads up, it's not all about fancy code craftsmanship. Solutions are more like hacky scripts to find the solution rather than ones following the most optimal method or code conventions. However, I have made it as readable as possible.

Feel free to dig into the solutions or fix any edge cases. I'll do a cleanup before New Years to archive this repository.
