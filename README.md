# Advent of Code

My Advent of Code solutions repository. Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. Here, you'll find my attempts at solving those puzzles using everyone's favorite Javascript.

### Days Completed
This is the progress for days that have both the parts solved and uploaded on this repository. Years not mentioned don't have any solutions uploaded.

| Year | Progress |
|--|--|
|2015| ![AOC 2015 Progress](https://progress-bar.xyz/8/?title=2%2F25%20)|
|2022| ![AOC 2022 Progress](https://progress-bar.xyz/8/?title=2%2F25%20)|
|2023| ![AOC 2023 Progress](https://progress-bar.xyz/40/?title=10%2F25%20)|
|2024| ![AOC 2024 Progress](https://progress-bar.xyz/96/?title=24%2F25%20)|

### Automation Script
You can use the `prepare.js` file to make folders, load template, and fetch input automatically for any of the days. Run it using `node prepare.js YYYY-DD`.
You need to have your session token and set it in config.json.

If it is not set, create the config file using the configure script:
`node configure.js <YOUR-SESSION-TOKEN>`

There will be three files made when it runs successfully:
- `P1.js`: Solution template for part one.
- `P2.js`: Solution template for part two.
- `in.dat`: User specific input used in both the parts.

### Few Reminders
Make sure you have at the very least attempted the puzzles beforehand if not already submitted the answers. I appreciate and encourage anyone who's looking to improving their own solutions by comparing approaches or researching about tricks. However, there is a fine line between researching ideas and using the answer by someone else. If you photocopy a crossword solution then what have you really achieved?

Also, just a heads up, there's an evident lack of code craftsmanship here. My solutions are more like hacky scripts to find the solution as fast as possible rather than ones following the most optimal method or code conventions. However, I have made it as readable as possible.


## Contribution
Please feel free to dig into the solutions and fix any edge cases! I'll do a cleanup before New Years to archive this repository (and probably C++ solutions? Go?! Who knows.). Thank you!
